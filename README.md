## Problem Statement Code: Evathon_PS_004

The global pandemic caused due to COVID-19 has changed the education model in the past couple of years. One crucial challenge for educators is to monitor attendance, both in terms of daily attendance and exams.

There is extensive research growing in building face-recognition monitoring systems. Face recognition is a task of pattern recognition that is specifically performed on faces. In other words, it can be described as classifying a face either known or unknown by comparing a face with stored known individuals in the database. It is also desirable to have a system that has the ability to learn to recognize unknown faces. Propose an evolutionary solution to build an online monitoring system for the education domain.

## Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic brought significant changes to the education sector. As schools and universities worldwide closed to prevent the virus's spread, traditional in-person instruction became impractical. This sudden shift required the rapid implementation of digital learning platforms to maintain educational continuity. Tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams enabled this transition but also introduced niche, repetitive challenges. For example, routine manual attendance marking became tedious, and the absence of face-to-face interaction made it difficult to determine how many students were actively participating in the lectures. 

We, thus, propose a facial recognition software that leverages genetic algorithms to accurately detect and identify each student's face. Once recognized, the software automatically records the student's attendance. Additionally, it monitors students' consistent attendance and active participation in lectures. This innovative solution streamlines the attendance process and provides valuable insights into student engagement, enhancing both administrative efficiency and the overall learning experience.
